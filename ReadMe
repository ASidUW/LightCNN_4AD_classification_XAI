Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease from Brain MRI Using a Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains code for training the lightWeight CNN models,  trained models, and visual explanations for classifying Alzheimer’s Disease from structural brain MRI.
We use a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras to discriminate between multiple cognitive states (e.g., Non Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, Moderate Demented).

For interpretability, we apply LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to visualize which brain regions most strongly influenced the model’s predictions.
